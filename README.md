# MotorCadeCore
A .NET Core powered 2D Game Engine, relying on Web Assembly and Blazor.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple C# based game engine, to quickly create 2D games (in a maintainable and testable way).

Eventually, the aim is to use Blazor to render the games using Web Assembly, but the engine should provide an interface to allow
other output sources in the future (e.g. WinForms/WPF/Xamarin).
